# 8-digit 7-segment LED Display Module 

<img src="https://github.com/uChip/Smaller_Bubble_Display/blob/master/8-dig%20display.png" alt="LED Display Module" height="260" width="390">  

This repo contains Eagle CAD PCB designs for an 8-digit LED display module based on the hp bubble display. The design files include schematic, board layout and BOM files.  There is also an Eagle library file that defines the module as an Eagle component.  

The module design utilizes a shift register to reduce the number of pins required to control the display.  

The software folder contains an Arduino sketch that provides example code to drive the display.   

See the file Forum-Posting.pdf for a more detailed explanation of the module design and software.
